This repo is the unpolished Python scripts to test router throughput.

It requires flent to be installed on your system to operate.

It is provided for reference and reflects organic growth of trying to
automate testing of OpenWrt routers' performance. As a result, it is
not guaranteed to work for you, is not documented, and it certainly 
contains its fair share of warts and poor coding practice.
